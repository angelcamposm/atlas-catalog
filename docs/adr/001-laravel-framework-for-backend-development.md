# ADR-001: Laravel Framework for Backend Development

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2023-10-27

## Context

The Atlas Catalog project requires a robust, modern, and maintainable backend framework to build a RESTful API. The key requirements for the framework include:

*   Rapid development lifecycle.
*   Strong support for API-first development.
*   Excellent testing capabilities to support a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.
*   High standards for security, code quality, and maintainability.
*   Leveraging the existing PHP expertise within the development team.
*   A rich ecosystem to avoid reinventing the wheel for common functionalities.

## Decision

We have chosen to use the **Laravel framework (v12.x)** with **PHP (v8.4+)** as the primary technology stack for the Atlas Catalog backend.

## Justification

Laravel is a highly opinionated, full-stack PHP framework that aligns perfectly with our project goals and constraints. The decision is based on the following factors:

1.  **Developer Experience & Productivity**: Laravel is renowned for its elegant syntax, comprehensive documentation, and developer-friendly features. This significantly speeds up development and onboarding of new team members.
2.  **API-First Design**: Laravel provides a complete toolkit for building robust RESTful APIs, including resource controllers, form requests for validation, API resources for data transformation, and built-in authentication (Sanctum). This aligns with our API-first guiding principle.
3.  **Robust Ecosystem**: The framework is backed by a massive ecosystem of first-party (like Pint, and Pest) and third-party packages. This allows us to quickly integrate features without building them from scratch.
4.  **Testing Framework**: Laravel has first-class support for both PHPUnit and Pest, which is our preferred testing framework. Its testing utilities make it straightforward to write feature and unit tests, which is crucial for our TDD strategy.
5.  **Security**: Laravel offers built-in security features, including protection against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF), fulfilling our security constraints.
6.  **Team Expertise**: Our team has strong expertise in PHP, making Laravel a natural choice that leverages our existing skills.
7.  **Community Support**: As one of the most popular PHP frameworks, Laravel has a large and active community, ensuring long-term support, frequent updates, and a wealth of available knowledge.

## Consequences

### Positive

*   **Increased Development Velocity**: We can build and iterate on features quickly.
*   **High Code Quality**: The framework's conventions and our established guidelines will lead to a clean, maintainable, and consistent codebase.
*   **Simplified Development**: Common tasks like routing, database management, authentication, and caching are abstracted and simplified.
*   **Strong Test Coverage**: The ease of testing will help us maintain comprehensive test coverage as required.
*   **Scalability**: While being a rapid development framework, Laravel is also scalable and can handle enterprise-level applications.

### Negative

*   **Opinionated Nature**: Laravel's conventions, while beneficial for consistency, can be restrictive if a highly unconventional feature is required.
*   **Performance Overhead**: As a full-stack framework, it can have more overhead than a micro-framework. This is a minor concern that can be mitigated with proper optimization and caching strategies.

## Alternatives Considered

*   **Symfony**: A powerful and flexible framework. It is less opinionated than Laravel but generally requires more initial setup and configuration, which could slow down initial development.
*   **Slim (Micro-framework)**: A lightweight framework suitable for small APIs. It would require us to manually integrate many components (like an ORM, validation library, etc.), which contradicts our goal of rapid development.
*   **Other Languages (Node.js/Express, Python/Django)**: These were considered but ultimately rejected to leverage the team's deep expertise in the PHP ecosystem.
