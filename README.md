## About Atlas Catalog

Atlas Catalog is a modern, RESTful API designed to serve as a centralized and comprehensive inventory for all microservices, APIs, and digital assets within an organization. Built on Laravel, it provides a robust and scalable solution for discovering, managing, and understanding the complex landscape of a distributed architecture.

Key features include:
- **Centralized Service Discovery**: A single source of truth for all your APIs and services.
- **Rich Metadata Management**: Track essential information such as endpoints, versions, ownership, access policies, and documentation.
- **Business Domain Organization**: Group services by business domains to provide clear context and ownership.
- **Standardized & RESTful**: A clean, predictable API that follows modern best practices for easy integration.
- **Extensible by Design**: Easily add new metadata or integrate with other developer tools.

Whether you are a developer looking for service documentation, a platform engineer managing the ecosystem, or an architect designing new systems, Atlas Catalog provides the visibility and control needed to navigate your microservices landscape with confidence.
